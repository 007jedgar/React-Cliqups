# Cliqups - React Native

CLIQUPS IS AN APP JUST FOR TEENS THAT LETS THEM CONNECT WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL :metal:

This readme will cover anything needed to get you started coding on this project!


### Requirements
- Xcode or Android Studio
- Text Editor
- Everything on the React native [Getting Started Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

### Instalation
A lot of `react-native` projects require a simple `npm i` to get going, but this one's a little stranger and uses a few rebel libraries and frameworks that don't always do what they're supposed to. 

###### In Addition to npm installing:
Keep an eye out for these dependecies, they may take some tinkering
```
"rn-fetch-blob": "github:joltup/rn-fetch-blob#master",
"react-native-firebase": "^4.3.8",
"react-native-image-picker": "^0.26.10",
```

run a `pod install && pod update` to be safe and if you're still gettting some errors link those bad boys manually!

You might have to set up a user with **Firebase Authentication**

Everything else is common react-native knowledge 

## ~ Happy Coding~
